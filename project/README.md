Welcome user. 

The following project to a fictional landing page for a heavy good transport vehicle. While the vehicle itself (find name) the use advertised on the page is not. 
The page will be used to promote the use of and possibly sell other products to potential buyers. 

The top of the page begins with the standard emmit boiler plate code. 
The head contains links to 

https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/
https://fontawesome.com/

The head section of the page also links to the css file which can be found in the github respository.
